 I want to tell you about my family. We are five people. My father, Tai, is 40 years old.
He is tall, handsome, and sells books. He likes reading and chess. My mother, Sen, is 34 years old.
She is short, beautiful, and sells goods. She likes cooking and movies. I have a brother, Hieu,
who is four years old. He likes toys and drawing. He has black hair and eyes. He is kind, helpful, 
playful, and curious. He is handsome and funny. I have a sister, Hang, who is 12 years old.
She likes studying and music. She has blonde hair and black eyes. She is thoughtful, cheerful, 
diligent, and polite. She is beautiful and smart. I love my family, especially my mother. 
She supports me always. We like to eat dinner together and talk. Sometimes we go to the park.
